                            Michael Lewis has a talent for creating immersive narratives based on complex subjects but written in plain language. <em><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Flash-Boys-Michael-Lewis/dp/0393244660" target="_blank">Flash Boys</a></em> is a story that highlights the backward incentives guiding Wall Street behaviour and affects anyone who’s ever bought stock. “Never before in human history have people gone to so much trouble and spent so much money to gain so little speed.” – August 2023

                            Being surrounded by dopamine triggers every day, it helps to know what happens to your brain when you seek pleasure or avoid pain. In <em><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Dopamine-Nation-Finding-Balance-Indulgence/dp/1524746746" target="_blank">Dopamine Nation</a></em>, Anna Lembke presents a primer on the dopamine system, explains the basis for any addictive behaviours and gives a framework for dealing with them. “We’re miserable because we’re working so hard to avoid being miserable.” – July 2023

                            There are hard-to-read philosophical books that are rewarding for the value they provide. There are easy-to-read books you enjoy for their entertainment. <em><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Atomised-Michel-Houellebecq/dp/0099283360" target="_blank">Atomised</a></em> by Michel Houllebecq tries to wedge itself somewhere in-between and shock you with sensationalism. As a result, the vulgarity reads vulgar, the philosophy reads flat, and the storyline goes nowhere. – July 2023

                            In his books, Robin Sloan brings together sci-fi mysteries, boyish nerdiness and San Francisco Bay tech culture. And <em><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Sourdough-Bonus-Story-Suitcase-Clone/dp/1250869692" target="_blank">Sourdough</a></em> is no exception. The novel touches on what it means to do meaningful work and how to be part of a community you cherish. It’s a light and straightforward story. “A thing I believe about people my age: we are the children of Hogwarts, we just want to be sorted.” – February 2023

As this, apparently, wasn’t unprofitable enough, they’d chosen the restaurant business as a way to lose their money more quickly and assuredly.” – November 2022

                            Sometimes I stumble upon books that I wish I’d written, and <em><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Less-Winner-Pulitzer-Prize-Novel/dp/0316316121" target="_blank">Less</a></em> by Andrew Sean Greer is one of those. It’s not a magnum opus. But it reads light, it’s playful, as if the author doesn’t take his hero and the whole story arc seriously. It’s a beach read. And do we need entertaining beach reads? Yes, yes, we do. “Boredom is the only real tragedy for a writer; everything else is material.” – August 2022

                            Teddy Roosevelt led by example when it came to living out a strenuous life. His tenacity, energy and drive were unparalleled. In <em><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Rise-Theodore-Roosevelt-Edmund-Morris/dp/0375756787" target="_blank">The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt</a></em>, Edmund Morris describes how one man lived a life that felt complete at 25, although it was only the beginning. “Satisfied that he had wasted not one minute of his waking hours.” – June 2022

It seems like a lot of unhappiness in life comes from being distracted, so why not work to avoid that? “We live in a world where almost everything is worthless and a very few things are exceptionally valuable.” – January 2022

Dealing with notions of entropy and the meaning of life, this memoir reads in a single breath and stays with you for many more. “The word hope appeared in English about 1,000 years ago, denoting … confidence and desire. But what I desired, life, was not what I was confident about, death.” – February 2017
