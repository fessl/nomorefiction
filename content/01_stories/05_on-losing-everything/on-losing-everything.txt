title: On Losing Everything
----
text: The first time it happened, I was driving southward on a highway across the border to see my parents in a small seaside town, about seven hours away. 

I saw the flashing lights of a cop’s car in a rearview mirror and pulled over. The officer took his time. 

– I’m afraid we’ll have to impound your car. 

I couldn’t believe it. 

– Excuse me? What … what for? 
– We received a call from your … car rental. Seems like you’ve exceeded your maximum allowed cap of 500 kilometres per trip. 

I looked at the dashboard. The trip meter read 525. 

– How can there be a limit? It’s a rental. 
– Well, have your read the terms & conditions? Says so right here. 

He gave me a printout of the car rental agreement. 

– Yes … no … I don’t know. 

The second time it happened while my car was being taken away by the tow truck. My landlord called. 

– I just emailed you an eviction notice, effective immediately. Your stuff is in the shed outside. 

I couldn’t believe it. 

– Excuse me? What … what for? 
– I received a call from the … utility company. Seems like you’ve exceeded your maximum allowed cap of 500 kWh per month. 

I checked my email. It said I’ve used 525 so far, probably due to keeping the AC on at all times. 

– How can there be a limit? It’s my apartment. 
– Well, have your read the terms & conditions? Says so right there. 
– God, you must be kidding me … 

The third time it happened as soon as I hung up the phone. A call from the airline. 

– Mr … we’ve just cancelled your return flight. 

I couldn’t believe it. 

– Excuse me? What … what for? 
– Our records show that you’ve skipped your flight today to … so we’ve cancelled the return as well, as per the agreement, of course.

I chose to rent a car one way at the last minute but was planning to come back home by plane.

– How can that be? I paid for the flight. 
– Well, have your read the terms & conditions? Says so in fine print.
– What the hell … 

The fourth time it happened when I tried to call a cab. The call got caught off and I received a text from the phone company instead. 

– We’re sorry to inform you that, as per the terms & conditions, we’ve terminated your contract due to the excessive use of roaming. 

I tried to send a middle-finger emoji back, but it failed to deliver. 

So here I am, sitting on a concrete road divider in July heat with the car rental terms & conditions in my hand. I laugh. I can only laugh. What a stupid situation to find yourself in. What a stupid, stupid day.
