text: It was getting dark. The sun has nearly set when my partner and I found ourselves on the most dangerous block in Chicago. I was standing against the wall, relaxed, hands in my pockets, talking to my partner when we noticed some black guys walking our way. They didn’t look good at all. We were there to watch, and that’s what we were doing, waiting till the company approached us. Not even thirty seconds later one of them came up to me and said:

– An whatcha doin here?
– Nothing, – I responded in the most polite tone I could master.
– Don ya think its not your kind o place-ah?
– Look, – I said, – we are just waiting for someone. Don’t bother us and we won’t bother you.
– Nobody is gonna bother me around here, ya understand?

The situation was getting slightly out of control. I was tempted to reach for my gun and blow this black guy’s head off. Instead, I signalled my partner ‘to go’, and we silently walked towards the other side of street. Predictably, it was not that easy.

– Where ya goin? I havent finished wit you, bitch!

He pulled out a knife. My partner was going to reach for a gun, but I stopped him. We can’t use guns, not now. If we fire, we’ll screw up the reason we are here in the first place. I had to think of a way to lose this guy, quickly. I wasn’t afraid of a knife. In my life, knives ceased to be scary.

But there was something wrong with this guy. I could feel his hatred. I could feel that if he comes close enough, I had a good chance of being stabbed. I looked over my shoulder to see if there was something even remotely representing a weapon. I saw a brick a couple feet away and stepped back to pick it up. Let’s see.

Surprised by us not fleeing, the guy slowed down for a moment, but then suddenly rushed towards me, his face full of eagerness to end my life. I raised a brick over my head, ready to smash his head if need be. The distance was shortening quickly. He was only about ten feet away when I heard the sound of a gun.

The boy fell on the pavement and remained motionless. His head just a half a few feet away from my boots. Angrily I looked back at my partner, for we’ve failed by opening a fire. But he hadn’t drawn his gun. It was not him who shot the boy.

I looked back at the black boy, lying face down with a knife still in his hand. I could see a bullet-sized hole in his shaved head. His friends were gone; it was just me, my partner, and the dead black boy out in the street on the most dangerous block in Chicago. I had to call the police. But then I realized, I was a policeman myself.
