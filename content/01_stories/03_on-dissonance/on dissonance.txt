text: It was around 11:30pm when Monika called, waking me up from a deep slumber.

– Can you come? I need you here.
– Yes, of course.

I felt my heart beating faster. She never calls. I got up and walked to the bathroom to wash my face. Pausing before the mirror, I noticed a few grey hairs in my stubble. My eyes looked tired.

I put on black jeans, a t-shirt, a pair of distressed leather boots, drank a glass of water and walked out of the house. A pleasantly refreshing breeze embraced me as I headed to the nearby neighbourhood.

She was outside, as beautiful as ever, wearing a green cocktail dress that reminded me of summer. Her lively ever-curious eyes looked straight into mine. She took my hand and led me up the street.

– Let’s go.

We walked a couple of blocks in silence. Then she turned to me as if to see that I was still there. She smiled and my heart sank. Some things you never get over.

I thought of her often. Accidentally for the most part. It takes a seemingly insignificant trigger: a day in a year, a quote mentioned by a friend, a street corner, the hair colour of a passerby. You tend to remember the good. The bad fades away.

She turned into an alley. There was a bar we used to frequent. This night, it was crowded, smoky and loud. A band was playing. We were passing through the throng; someone I knew tapped me on the shoulder. The adjacent room was quieter, and we sat at the bar.

– Two vodkas, please.

The bartender placed two shots beside us. She downed hers. Then took mine and downed it as well.

– So what is it about?

She paused. The light from above the bar illuminated her face. Enchanting, but not mine anymore.

– I still love you.

I woke up to the trill of a ringing phone and found myself on the couch in my living room, with a book on my chest. Must had fallen asleep reading. I saw my cellphone and picked it up. It was her.

– Can you come? I need you here.
– No.
