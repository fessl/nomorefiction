text: Without a doubt, *(link: https://www.amazon.ca/When-Breath-Becomes-Paul-Kalanithi/dp/081298840X text: When Breath Becomes Air target: _blank)* is the book I recommend to all. Dealing with notions of entropy and the meaning of life, this memoir reads in a single breath and stays with you for many more. ‘The word hope appeared in English about 1,000 years ago, denoting … confidence and desire. But what I desired, life, was not what I was confident about, death.’ – February 2017
