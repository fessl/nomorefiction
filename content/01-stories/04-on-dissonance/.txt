title: On Being Ambitious
----
text: On September 21, around three in the afternoon, Al was walking home from high school, following his everyday route: along Sinclair Street, then left and down Frederick Avenue. Unlike most teenagers, Al wasn’t listening to music. Instead, he was preoccupied with analyzing his prospects of getting into Harvard. Al was 18 years old. 

Harvard wasn’t easy to get into, but it was the only school on Al’s mind. Thinking of it consumed virtually every minute of his time. Al was working hard to get the best grades while playing basketball for the school team. He was a decent player, but could have been better if he liked the game. Money wasn’t a problem — when Al was born, his parents set up a college fund for him. They were morticians: doing very well, actually.

Al wanted to go to Harvard to study finance. In four years, as a graduate, he would join an investment bank as a junior financial analyst, from where he imagined steadily climbing the ladder until gaining enough confidence to move on. He would then quit to start a hedge fund, accelerating his way into early retirement. Family wasn’t a priority: around 35 could be a good time, or, you know, once the business is stable. Al’s plan was to make enough to get out at 45, then devoting his time to the things he loved: travelling, music, and raising children. There will be plenty of time to do all that, he thought. 

Girls liked Al. He was good-looking and seemed mysterious. Amy, his classmate, invited him on a date, but he never went. In fact, nobody has ever remembered Al going on a date. He just didn’t seem to have time. Last year, Al’s classmates went on a trip to San Francisco, but Al didn’t go. A few months ago, there was a party at Chris’s, when his parents left town, but Al didn’t come. Al’s younger sister, Mary, bought marijuana once, but Al didn’t try. 

Al was approaching his house when he saw Mrs. Kinsley, a retired neighbour, standing outside anxiously. 

– Hello, Mrs. Kinsley. What’s happening?

– My cat. She went up that tree and isn’t coming down. Do you think you can get her? 

– Sure… No problem. – Al took his backpack off. 

In-between two properties stood an old oak: mighty and high. Al raised his head and, squinting, saw a small cat at the very top. He grasped the lowest hanging branch and pulled himself up. Al climbed slowly. Occasionally, some branches would dangerously squeak under his weight. Half way there, Al glanced down and noticed how vertigo started to crawl on him. He swallowed heavily but continued the climb, continuously calling the cat’s name. Finally, the cat was close enough. Al extended his arm to grab her, when the branch underneath broke off, and he slipped.  

There was a thud followed by the scream of Mrs. Kinsley. Al was 18 years old.
