text: Without a doubt, (link: https://www.amazon.ca/When-Breath-Becomes-Paul-Kalanithi/dp/081298840X text: When Breath Becomes Air popup: yes) is the book I would recommend to everyone. Dealing with notions of entropy and the meaning of life, this memoir reads in one breath and stays with you for many more. ‘The word hope appeared in english about a 1000 years ago, denoting some combination of confidence and desire. But what I desired — life — was not what I was confident about — death.’ – February 2017
