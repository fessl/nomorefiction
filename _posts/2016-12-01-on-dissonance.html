                <p>It was around 11:30pm when Monika called, waking me up from a deep slumber.</p>
                <p>
                  – Can you come? I need you here.
                  <br/>
                  – Yes, of course.
                </p>
                <p>I felt my heart beating faster. She never calls. I got up and walked to the bathroom to wash my face. Pausing before the mirror, I noticed a few grey hairs in my stubble. My eyes looked tired.</p>
                <p>I put on black jeans, a t-shirt, a pair of distressed leather boots, drank a glass of water and walked out of the house. A pleasantly refreshing breeze embraced me as I headed to the nearby neighbourhood.</p>
                <p>She was outside, as beautiful as ever, wearing a green cocktail dress that reminded me of summer. Her lively ever-curious eyes looked straight into mine. She took my hand and led me up the street.</p>
                <p>– Let’s go.</p>
                <p>We walked a couple of blocks in silence. Then she turned to me as if to see that I was still there. She smiled and my heart sank. Some things you never get over.</p>
                <p>I thought of her often. Accidentally for the most part. It takes a seemingly insignificant trigger: a day in a year, a quote mentioned by a friend, a street corner, the hair colour of a passerby. You tend to remember the good. The bad fades away.</p>
                <p>She turned into an alley. There was a bar we used to frequent. This night, it was crowded, smoky and loud. A band was playing. We were passing through the throng; someone I knew tapped me on the shoulder. The adjacent room was quieter, and we sat at the bar.</p>
                <p>– Two vodkas, please.</p>
                <p>The bartender placed two shots beside us. She downed hers. Then took mine and downed it as well.</p>
                <p>– So what is it about?</p>
                <p>She paused. The light from above the bar illuminated her face. Enchanting, but not mine anymore.</p>
                <p>– I still love you.</p>
                <p>I woke up to the trill of a ringing phone and found myself on the couch in my living room, with a book on my chest. Must had fallen asleep reading. I saw my cellphone and picked it up. It was her.</p>
                <p>
                  – Can you come? I need you here.
                  <br/>
                  – No.
