                <p>The first time it happened, I was driving southward on a highway across the border to see my parents in a small seaside town, about seven hours away.</p>
                
                <p>I saw the flashing lights of a cop’s car in a rearview mirror and pulled over. The officer took his time.</p>
                
                <p>“I’m afraid we’ll have to impound your car.”</p>
                
                <p>I couldn’t believe it.</p>
                
                <p>“Excuse me? What … what for?”</p>
                
                <p>“We received a call from your … car rental. Seems like you’ve exceeded your maximum allowed cap of 500 kilometres per trip.”</p>
                
                <p>I looked at the dashboard. The trip meter read 525.</p>
                
                <p>“How can there be a limit? It’s a rental.”</p>
                
                <p>“Well, have your read the terms & conditions? Says so right here.”</p>
                
                <p>He gave me a printout of the car rental agreement.</p>
                
                <p>“Yes … no … I don’t know.”</p>
                
                <p>The second time it happened while my car was being taken away by the tow truck. My landlord called.</p>
                
                <p>“I just emailed you an eviction notice, effective immediately. Your stuff is in the shed outside.”</p>
                
                <p>I couldn’t believe it.</p>
                
                <p>“Excuse me? What … what for?”</p>
                
                <p>“I received a call from the … utility company. Seems like you’ve exceeded your maximum allowed cap of 500 kWh per month.”</p>
                
                <p>I checked my email. It said I’ve used 525 so far, probably due to keeping the AC on at all times.</p>
                
                <p>“How can there be a limit? It’s my apartment.”</p>
                
                <p>“Well, have your read the terms & conditions? Says so right there.”</p>
                
                <p>“God, you must be kidding me …”</p>
                
                <p>The third time it happened as soon as I hung up the phone. A call from the airline.</p>
                
                <p>“Mr … we’ve just cancelled your return flight.”</p>
                
                <p>I couldn’t believe it.</p>
                
                <p>“Excuse me? What … what for?”</p>
                
                <p>“Our records show that you’ve skipped your flight today to … so we’ve cancelled the return as well, as per the agreement, of course.”</p>
                
                <p>I chose to rent a car one way at the last minute but was planning to come back home by plane.</p>
                
                <p>“How can that be? I paid for the flight.”</p>
                
                <p>“Well, have your read the terms & conditions? Says so in fine print.”</p>

                <p>“What the hell …”</p>
                
                <p>The fourth time it happened when I tried to call a cab. The call got caught off and I received a text from the phone company instead.</p>
                
                <p>“We’re sorry to inform you that, as per the terms & conditions, we’ve terminated your contract due to the excessive use of roaming.”</p>
                
                <p>I tried to send a middle-finger emoji back, but it failed to deliver.</p>
                
                <p>So here I am, sitting on a concrete road divider in July heat with the car rental terms &amp; conditions in my hand. I laugh. I can only laugh. What a stupid situation to find yourself in. What a stupid, stupid day.</p>
