                <p>Ghosts are real. You can’t see them, but you can feel them. They follow you. They haunt you. Some of them eventually fade away; others stay for life.</p>
                <p><em>Step 1: Fill up a thin-spout pouring kettle with 400 ml of cold water. Turn on a gas stove.</em></p>
                <p>Unlike what you see in movies, real ghosts are not see-through dead people. When they want to appear, they just enter your mind. When they are done, they leave.</p>
                <p><em>Step 2: Use a kitchen scale to weigh 30 grams of freshly roasted coffee beans. Then manually grind them with a Japanese ceramic mill, aiming for course but even grounds.</em></p>
                <p>Every ghost is there for a reason, even if that reason seems opaque to you at first. While ghosts don’t have to look like people, they come from interactions with people. Every action leaves a trail that might become a ghost for someone else.</p>
                <p><em>Step 3: Heat up the French press by swishing around 50 ml of boiling water, then empty it out.</em></p>
                <p>Human interactions require closure. When they are left hanging, doors that should be closed are being left ajar. Soon, the ghosts start coming in. They fill the voids. They attach themselves to words, gestures and actions.</p>
                <p><em>Step 4: Put coffee in the French press. Pour 60 ml of water, stir the grounds with a spoon and let them bloom for 30 seconds.</em></p>
                <p>You’ve said something without thinking, and now it’s too late. The ghosts are forming. You say you’re sorry, but the ghosts won’t leave. They are becoming part of you, and you have to live with them.</p>
                <p><em>Step 5: Fill up the French press with water. Place the lid on top. Wait for 4 minutes.</em></p>
                <p>There are cries for help. Someone is in trouble. You want to save them, but you can’t. You’re too young. Your body fails you. You’re stunned, left there standing and watching the pain unfold. Finally, you use all your strength to run away and hide. The ghost is unlocked.</p>
                <p>You don’t keep your promise and let people down. You have a million reasons why, but each one sends a signal for ghosts to consider.</p>
                <p>Someone important to you pisses you off, so you shut them out of your life forever. You think you’re done, but closure was not there.</p>
                <p><em>Step 6: Press the filter down. Pour coffee into a mug.</em></p>
                <p>You go through life accumulating ghosts. Some stay; some go. Some torment you; others keep out of the way and wait for their perfect moment.</p>
                <p>You can’t avoid your ghosts forever. But, sometimes, you can try to act in a way the ghosts would have no reason to exist.</p>
                <p><em>The coffee is now cold.</em></p>
